### About

A wonky idea I had to make a collection of easy to understand generic data structures, algorithms, and whatever for Swift.

Have you ever been working on a project, and just needed a simple (mostly) ready to use version of DS, Algo, or whatever.

Or you come across something you want to try, and you just need bit any pieces of something, just to see it work.

Sure you look around for a library, but all the libraries you comes across are always speciallized in some way.

Or if you want to implement psuedo come you come across, you cannot just put it to use because you have to build smaller parts of the psuedo code just to get it to work.

That is where this came from.  A couple of personal projects I was working on, I would need one or two speciallized pieces of code just to see if the prototype would work.

However, whatever I found for those small pieces of felt like I needs to spend a couple of semesters taking special topic classes just to effectily use them.

This (ideally) is to get around that just so people can play with code ideas more.


### Goals

* The code (minus the focus on being generic) must be readable and well documented.  Image you are writing something you want your 12-year-old cousin or 82-year-old grandmother to understand.

This means avoiding optimization tricks in-favor of clarity.  State what you are doing and do only that, no matter how verbose it is.

* The code should be able to replace any good psuedo-code 1:1 (or as close as it can get)
